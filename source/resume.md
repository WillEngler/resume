### Experience {#experience}

Rockwell Automation
: *Software Engineering Co-op*
  __January 2014 - August 2014__
  Worked with another co-op to take our team's unit test suite from unusable to a vital part of our production pipeline by restructuring the tests and building a continuous delivery pipeline with Jenkins.

  Designed and implemented feature for a controls engineering IDE in C++. Worked across engineering, UX, testing, and project management teams to build consensus on requirements.

[Pitt Computer Science Club](http://pittcsc.org/)
: *Cofounder and Vice President*
  __August 2014 - April 2015__
  Grew a community to make Pitt a more welcoming place to study CS-related fields.

  Hosted weekly meetups to let members share what they've learned and built outside of the classroom. Personally delivered talks and workshops on Ruby on Rails, TDD, and "Functional Programming for Mortals."

  Connected Pitt students to Pittsburgh tech meetups and startups. Helped organize [SteelHacks](http://steelhacks.com/), the first pan-Pittsburgh student hackathon.

  Helped start mentoring program and personally mentored five beginners. Focused on recruiting and mentoring females and minorities.

Pitt Public Health Dynamics Laboratory
: *Undergraduate Research Fellow*

### Showcase Projects {#projects}

Chi-Learn
: *Given a history of crime in Chicago up to today, predict which neighborhoods will see a violent crime tomorrow.*

  [Visualization](http://chi-learn.github.io/chi-learn/) | [Technical Overview](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/chi-learn/chi-learn/blob/master/clearn/notebooks/CS1675_Presentation.ipynb) | [Code](https://github.com/chi-learn/chi-learn) | Team: [Joel Roggeman](https://github.com/jroggeman), [Kevin Minkus](https://github.com/kcm30)

  Used Python, Pandas, SciKit-Learn to apply machine learning algorithms to Chicago's open crime data. Used D3.js to visualize our algorithms' performance over baseline.

SwipeMe
: *An Uber-esque service to let Pitt students buy and sell dining-hall passes.*
  [Code](https://github.com/SwipeMe/SwipeMe) | Team: [Joel Roggeman](https://github.com/jroggeman), [Tommy Bednar](https://github.com/TommyBednar)

  Used Twilio to create an SMS-only interface between buyers and sellers. Students selling dining hall passes send an SMS to check in to the service when they are physically available to use their student ID to swipe in a buyer. Buyers send a text when they arrive to get matched with a seller.

  We abandoned the project because we wanted to focus on our studies instead of marketing, maintenance, etc.
