### Experience {#experience}

University of Chicago Urban Center for Computation and Data
: *Lead Software Engineer - Plenar.io*
  __September 2015 - Present__
  Led development of Plenario ([site](http://plenar.io/) | [code](https://github.com/UrbanCCD-UChicago/plenario)), a hub for open data about cities that eases data preparation and discovery work for policy makers and urban scientists. Our API supports projects like [OpenGrid](http://opengrid.io). 

  Expanded range of supported geospatial data from points (like crime reports at a specific place and time) to polygons (like neighborhood boundaries) and line segments (like streets).

  Optimized code and revamped AWS deployment to take our max concurrent users from several hundred to several thousand.

  Supervised two student engineers, providing mentorship and delegating development tasks.

  Tools used: PostgreSQL with PostGIS | Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy | JavaScript with Backbone and Leaflet.

Rockwell Automation
: *Software Engineering Co-op*
  __January 2014 - August 2014__
  Worked with another co-op to take our team's unit test suite from unusable to a vital part of our production pipeline. Restructured tests and automated test execution with Jenkins.

  Designed and implemented feature for a controls engineering IDE in C++. Worked across engineering, UX, testing, and project management teams to build consensus on requirements.

[Pitt Computer Science Club](http://pittcsc.org/)
: *Cofounder and Vice President*
  __August 2014 - April 2015__

  Hosted weekly meetups to let members share what they've learned and built outside of the classroom.

  Delivered talks and workshops on Ruby on Rails, TDD, and "Functional Programming for Mortals."

  Helped organize the inaugural [SteelHacks](http://steelhacks.com/), the first pan-Pittsburgh student hackathon.

  Helped start mentoring program and personally mentored five beginners.

### Undergrad Showcase Projects {#projects}

Chi-Learn
: *Given a history of crime in Chicago up to today, predict which neighborhoods will see a violent crime tomorrow.*

  [Visualization](http://chi-learn.github.io/chi-learn/) | [Technical Overview](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/chi-learn/chi-learn/blob/master/clearn/notebooks/CS1675_Presentation.ipynb) | [Code](https://github.com/chi-learn/chi-learn)

  Used Python, Pandas, SciKit-Learn to apply machine learning algorithms to Chicago's open crime data. Used D3.js to visualize our algorithms' performance over baseline.

SwipeMe
: *Let Pitt students buy and sell dining-hall passes.*
  [Code](https://github.com/SwipeMe/SwipeMe)

  Sellers send an SMS to the service when they are available to swipe in a buyer with their student ID. Buyers send a text when they arrive to get matched with a seller.
  Used Python, Twilio, Google App Engine.
