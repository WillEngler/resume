### Showcase Projects {#projects}

Chi-Learn
: *Given a history of crime in Chicago up to today, predict which neighborhoods will see a violent crime tomorrow.*

  [Visualization](http://chi-learn.github.io/chi-learn/) | [Technical Overview](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/chi-learn/chi-learn/blob/master/clearn/notebooks/CS1675_Presentation.ipynb) | [Code](https://github.com/chi-learn/chi-learn)

  Used Python, Pandas, SciKit-Learn to apply machine learning algorithms to Chicago's open crime data. Used D3.js to visualize our algorithms' performance over baseline.

SwipeMe
: *Let Pitt students buy and sell dining-hall passes.*
  [Code](https://github.com/SwipeMe/SwipeMe)

  Sellers send an SMS to the service when they are available to swipe in a buyer with their student ID. Buyers send a text when they arrive to get matched with a seller.
  Used Python, Twilio, Google App Engine.

Rust Language Regex Library
: *Improving performance of regular expression matching for the Rust programming language.*
  [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/66)

  Work in progress. Implementing a DFA-based matching engine to complement
  the existing NFA-based engine.
